					<description><![CDATA[There’s Always a New Cybersecurity Threat – Let Webroot Help. Nearly half of all consumers worldwide have been victims of cybercrime. Every link clicked, email opened, app downloaded, and network joined is an opportunity for hackers to compromise your personal data. Webroot offers complete protection from viruses and identity theft for all your devices – without slowing you down. Powerful, lightweight, and integrated protection for PC, Mac, and Android, Webroot Internet Security Complete with antivirus protects personal information by blocking the latest malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks. Fully cloud-based and faster than our competitors, we scan billions of apps, files, and websites continuously to determine where and what is safe online. This enables us to store malware definitions in the cloud and identify them in real-time, and provide an effective shield while maintaining a small footprint on your device.
