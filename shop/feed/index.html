										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trend Micro Titanium Internet Security is strong, advanced, easy-to-use protection for what you and your family do online every day – email, socialize, bank, browse, and shop. It features set-and-forget security that won’t pester you with annoying alerts and pop-ups.<br />
Titanium pre-sets web threat protection to block malicious links and downloads in emails, instant messages, or websites. This recommended level of security protects you from online phishing scams that try to steal credit card or other personal financial information.<br />
Titanium’s social networking security automatically scans your Facebook wall or Twitter feed and shows you safe links by highlighting them in green. Potentially malicious ones are highlighted in red. Titanium can help prevent hackers and spyware from stealing credit card numbers, passwords, and other sensitive data.</p>
